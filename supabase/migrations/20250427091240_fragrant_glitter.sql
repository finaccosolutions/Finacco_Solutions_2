  # Fix profiles table RLS policy

  1. Changes
    - Drop and recreate the SELECT policy for profiles table to fix infinite recursion
    
  2. Security
    - Maintains RLS security while fixing the recursion issue
    - Users can still only read their own profile
    - Admins can read all profiles without causing recursion
*/

  -- Allow users to read their own profile
